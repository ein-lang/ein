# Core language library

This is a library of the core language. It consists of the following components.

- AST
- Compiler
- Types

## Design

- Correct AST's are always compiled without errors.
- Everything is typed already.
- The language is agnostic to modules and packages in the higher-level language.
- Top-level definitions are unordered.
